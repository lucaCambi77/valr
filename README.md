# VALR | Assessment | Backend Engineer

Build a working, in-memory order book to place a limit order with order matching including the
ability to view all open orders.
The API should have at-least the following endpoints:

1. Get order book: Use this API as a reference for request and response payload
   https://api.valr.com/BTCZAR/orderbook
2. Submit limit order: Use this API as a reference for request and response payload
   https://api.valr.com/v1/orders/limit. This can be a very simple data structure and does not
   need to cater for all the advanced usages. Feel free to ask if you have any questions here.
   (see https://docs.valr.com for the API reference if needed)
3. Recent Trades : Similar to https://api.valr.com/BTCZAR/tradehistory
